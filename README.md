# Pug vim
## What is Pug Vim?
Pug Vim is my personal configuration for Neovim, which I have decided to post 
on GitHub as both a staging point for me to move between machines and to share
with anyone that wants it (though I highly encourage you to write your own!).
Organization and format is mostly based on the [Neovim From
Scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) series by [Christian
Chiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli).

Though it was initially setup as a development platform, I mostly only use
it now for writing; the development configuration still exists, though.

The name comes from the *nom de guerre* that I use for most things related to 
gaming/non-professional online identities, TheSaltyPug (Also, pugs as a dog 
breed are pretty neat).

## Whats included?
Pug Vim is a semi-comprehensive vim configuration, designed to mimic
IDEs such as VScode. Pug Vim currently has:
- Intelligent autocomplete
- Some themes
- Auto brackets
- Git integration
- Intelligent fuzzy-finding
- A file explorer
- Prose writing support

## Plugin List
TODO- list out the plugins

## KeyMappings
TODO- list custom mappings and commands

## TODO
This is a list of things I may or may not want to eventually
do with this config. Its mine... I'll do what I want!

### High Priority
- List the plugins in the section on the README
- List custom key mappings and commands on the README
- Fix mcfunction language server (working, but needs more tweaking to get colors 
right, also can not auto install yet)

### Low Priority
- ~~Switch from FZF to telescope~~ Done
- ~~Treesitter~~ Done
