# Pug vim
## What is Pug Vim?
Pug Vim is my personal configuration for Neovim, which I
have decided to post on GitHub as both a staging point
for me to move between machines and to share with anyone
that wants it.

The name comes from the *nom de guerre* that I use for
most things related to gaming/non-professional online
identities, TheSaltyPug (Also, pugs as a dog breed are
pretty neat).

## Whats included?
Pug Vim is a A semi-comprehensive vim configuration, designed to mimic
IDEs such as VScode. Pug Vim currently has:
- Intelligent autocomplete
- Some themes
- Auto brackets
- Git integration
- Intelligent fuzzy-finding
- A file explorer
